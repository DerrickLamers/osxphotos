Contributions of all kinds are welcome!  You don't need to know python to contribute to this project. For example, documentation updates are just as welcome as code!

Please explore open [issues](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues), [discussions](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/discussions), and the project [wiki](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/wiki) to learn more about the project.

If you want to contribute source code, I recommend you explore the [wiki](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/wiki/Structure-of-the-code) to learn about the source structure first.

See the [README.md](tests/README.md) in the tests directory before running any tests.

Before contributing, please read [README_DEV.md](README_DEV.md) for information on setting up a development environment and opening a pull request.
